When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    #When working on a poroject with a team, or when you have to work from another machine. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    #You might want to pull changes from a branch at a certian commit point. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    #Forks are GitHub hosted clones for a given account, Clones are copies of a repository either locally or on a cloud service like GitHub, and branches are versions of a program repository. I would use forks instead of cloning because it is all on github instead of having to put the data on my own system. I would use cloning to work with the code personally, and each of them i would use branches to specify my version of a given program. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    #You could fast forward merge in a project. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    #It would be more difficult to collaborate, becuase you would have to give someone the file manually, and if it changed you wouldnt be able to track it down unless you were very familiar with each line, which would get out of control in a larger project. Much harder. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    #You would be able to work on seperate files that pretain to master and you could merge with master after people are in agreement. also allows for errors.
